            <p>Welcome to the client site of TeamOne - a team of bright and motivated students sharing the COMP 1950 experience.  This site provides information about the TeamOne members, the team's methodology in completing the term project and outlines a rationale for several proposed changes to the existing COMP 1950 website <a href="http://thenet.ca/1950">(thenet.ca/1950)</a>.  Links are also provided here to a proto-site which gives our client a clear sense of the team's vision for a new and improved COMP 1950 website.</section>

            <header><h2> Team Members</h2></header>
			<p>All team members participated in the creative design process and worked together to develop a consensus on the recommendations which have been provided here.  Teamwork was highly collaborative, however it was appropriate to divide up the work of producing the client site, proto-site and blog into smaller workgroups of one or two people.  The following lists the contributions of each of the team members:</p>

            <header><h2>Methodology</h2></header>
            
            <p>The first step in the project was for the entire team to participate in brainstorming ideas for improving the existing site.  This involved reviewing the questionnaire answers which were provided by Alistair, discussing the purpose(s) of the website, and identifying items for improvement.  The team was also motivated by Alistair's remarks in class that this project was an opportunity to "bring it all together", i.e. to showcase all of the skills that we had learned during COMP 1950.  Out of this process came a vision for a new site, outlined in the <a href="rationale.html">Rationale</a> section of this client site.</p>
            
            <p>The project manager, Rod, divided the project into smaller tasks, for which teams of two volunteered to take responsibility.  A Dropbox folder was used for miscellaneous documents such as draft content, to-do lists and the task breakdown structure. A Git repository was used extensively to organize code development.  </p>

            <h2>Bringing It Together</h2></header>
            <p>It was important to TeamOne that their work on this project showcase the skills they have learned by taking COMP1950.  The following list outlines how and where these skills have been employed:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>file/folder names all lowercase, no spaces, etc (week 1)</li>
            <li>semantic markup used extensively to separate code from style, logical styles (week 2)</li>
            <li>content optimized for SEO: use distinct titles, meta descriptions, etc (week 3)</li>
            <li>used HTML5 elements appropriately (week 3)</li>
            <li>CSS: two media for assignment - screen and print (week 4, week 5), proper use of selectors, etc. CSS should validate correctly.</li>
            <li>CSS: use a reset (normalize.css)(week 5)</li>
            <li>SSI: use SSI to include common code in proto-site: header(s) footer, navigation (week 6)</li>
            <li>CMS/Templates: we are using Github for code-control, and rolling out a blog using Tumblr (week 7, week 8)</li>
            <li>Methodology: Disciplined methodology used, and this client site includes a section which discusses methodology (week 9)</li>
			<li>Javascript and JQuery: Accordion-style navigation menu on proto-site uses JQuery (week 10)</li>
            </ul>
