            <section><header><h2>Rationale:</h2></header>

            <p>To create ideas for how to improve the existing site, the team reviewed the existing site using a best-practice framework:  content , appearance  and behaviour.     The following sections describe the results of this review and the implications for the recommended re-design.</p></section>
            
            <section><header><h2>Content</h2></header>
            <p>The team agreed that the existing content of the website is both comprehensive and relevant to the material being taught.  Out-of-date content does not seem to be an issue.  However, it was noted that there is some material included in the Week 1 page which properly belongs with the other generic information which is provided in the generic Home page.<p>
            
            <p><strong><em>Recommendation:</em> 	That the content from the Outline and Other Subjects section, currently in the Week 1 page,  be moved to the Home page.</strong></p></section>

            <section><header><h2>Appearance</h2></header>

            <p>The layout of COMP1950 site needs to be influenced by the purpose for which the site is used.  The team identified two primary uses for the site: as reference material during Alistair's lectures, and as a learning resource for the COMP1950 students.  The existing site serves the first purpose very well - the organization of the material within each page follows the order in which Alistair chooses to present the topics.  If there is insufficient time to cover all topics, certain sections can be easily skipped so as to keep the lecture within the allotted time.  However, as a resource for students who want to use the lecture pages as a resource for review or further learning, there is room for improvement.</p>

            <p>The team felt that the layout should be enhanced to make it easier for students to find specific subject matter.  In addition, the team noted that some subjects, such as CSS, are so broad that as many as three lectures are devoted to various aspects of the subject.  Currently, there are very few cues as to the differences in content between each of the lectures.   The team concluded that additional descriptive text in the vertical navigation bar on the right side of the page is needed.</p>
            
            
            <p><strong><em>Recommendation:</em> 	That a more detailed navigation menu, with sub-headings corresponding to each major topic in each class, be implemented.</strong></p>
            
            <p>To further assist visitors in finding relevant material, the team believes that a simple site search tool, using Google code, would be helpful.  This tool would be placed in the site header, where it would be easily accessed.</p>
            
            <p><strong><em>Recommendation:</em> Implement a Google site search form in the header section of the new site.</strong></p>
            
            <p>The team also noted that the color scheme used by the existing site, while excellent for readability, is not consistent with the color scheme used on the main bcit.ca website.  This, together with the observation that the course website is not hosted by bcit.ca, gives the impression that the course may not be fully aligned with BCIT standards and methods.</p>
            
            <p><strong><em>Recommendation:</em>  	That the color scheme used by the COMP1950 website be consistent with the bcit.ca website color scheme.</strong></p></section>

            <section><header><h2>Behaviour</h2></header>
            <p>Some additional functionality is suggested to make the Agenda more of a useful tool to visitors in finding specific page content.  Each agenda topic should become a hypertext link which will take the user directly to the section of the page where that topic is discussed.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Recommendation:</em> 	That the navigation menu have accordion-style functionality, so that when the visitor clicks on a specific heading for a class, a list of sub-headings appears which provides links to the corresponding location on the page for that sub-heading's content.</strong></p></section>
